Half of AI researchers think that in around 35 years unaided machines will be able to accomplish every task better and cheaper than human workers. However, few of them voice concerns about the strong economic disruptions that are likely to occur due to productivity gains well before most jobs are automated, including employment shocks and inequality that we may see within 20 years. Automation offers the potential for a higher standard of living through increased productivity, but realizing this potential requires a protopian mindset. Protopia is a gradual, continuous improvement of society that prioritizes contemporary problems. In context of the automation risks we are facing today, it is important to adapt our economic models to be robust against challenges that society could face soon. The few existing theoretical policy proposals, such as UBS and UBI, are both incomplete and not extensively tested. The future in which labor is partially or fully automated is a serious concern, which society needs to prepare for by adapting economic structures through exploration and extensive testing of new economic policies.

Researchers think that AI will soon be as advanced as humans in intellectual tasks. Half of the AI experts surveyed predict that human-level machine intelligence (HLMI) will emerge by 2061 or sooner  (Roser, 2023). Similarly, Ajeya Cotra’s compute-based model placed a milestone around 2050  (Roser, 2023). The convergence across these predictions hints that the forecasts are not arbitrary, but it is worth noting that experts do not have a good track record in making forecasts about their own field  (Roser, 2023). Still, their input is valuable because they build this technology and understand what is possible. People who specialize in making forecasts can tell better when advancements will happen, as research showed they are surprisingly accurate at that (Roser, 2023). One such group, Metaculus, estimated a 50% chance of achieving artificial general intelligence as early as 2040 (Roser, 2023). It is worth noting that several independent timelines — expert surveys, Cotra’s model, and Metaculus — shortened significantly in early 2022 (Roser, 2023); this was before ChatGPT was released but it is consistent with the rapid progress that was observed at the time.

Beyond speculative timelines, recent evaluations of AI capabilities already suggest that generalization and expert-level performance are becoming a reality. Today large language models are achieving and surpassing expert level capabilities across many fields on benchmarks. For example, there is the GPQA benchmark, which consists of 448 challenging questions written by experts in biology, physics, and chemistry (Rein, 2024). According to the authors of the benchmark, "Experts who have or are pursuing PhDs in the corresponding domains reach 74%, while highly skilled non-expert validators only reach 34% accuracy, despite spending on average over 30 minutes with unrestricted access to the web" (Rein, 2024, p. 1). Unrestricted access to the internet along with only 34% success illustrates the difficulty of the questions. Claude 3 Opus, a state-of-the-art (SOTA) large language model at the time of GPQA's release, achieved 60% on the benchmark (Rein, 2024, p. 1) and was approaching PhD-level performance. In April of 2025, OpenAI released o3 with a reported GPQA score of 83.3% on the hardest subset GPQA Diamond (OpenAI, 2025, 11:11). This result is impressive as it scores higher than domain experts, but it is worth noting that OpenAI could include benchmark questions in the training data set. They also released o4-mini, which achieved 2719 ELO points on Codeforces, a website that hosts competitive programming contests (OpenAI, 2025, 11:11). This puts o4-mini in the top 200 leaderboard globally. Such results cannot be explained by regurgitation of the training data set alone — they are a result of the new powerful reasoning paradigm, which is expected to deliver more capability increases in the near future. LLM performance evaluations show that they are highly generalized systems that can match and even surpass experts. The protopian response to current capabilities is to stay one step ahead and to anticipate the effects of new SOTA AI models on society, which will definitely impact productivity across the board. 

Despite benchmarks not always directly translating to performance in real world tasks, it seems like AI already has wide effects on the job market. According to Wong (2024, para. 6), "Current evidence indicates that AI is replacing human labor, either fully or partially, at a faster pace than anticipated across various job sectors. These roles include voice actors, forex traders in investment banking, news writers, screenwriters, software engineers, coders, data analysts, lawyers, and graphic designers". The fact that large language models are useful across such a wide variety of tasks again highlights their strong generalization capabilities in contrast to previous neural networks that could only master narrow skills like playing games of chess and Go. These generalization capabilities paired with accessibility and ease of use resulted in AI's wide adoption. A survey from June 2024 finds that "75% of 31,000 professionals across 31 countries are currently using AI in their daily work" (Wong, 2024, "Reviewing the Status of Job Automation," para. 8). Wide adoption also signifies that workers saw benefits to their productivity from using AI, even from models that were released in the first half of 2024 or earlier, which quickly became legacy compared to the newest models. According to Anthropic's recent observations from 4 million conversations, "∼36% of occupations show usage in at least 25% of their tasks, indicating that AI has already begun to diffuse into task portfolios across a substantial portion of the workforce"  (Handa et al., 2025, p. 2). With increased productivity, achieving the same output will require less work. Yes, many fields, like software development, have unmet demand and will increase output, but this does not apply to every field. It means that as AI capabilities keep increasing, at some point productivity gains may hit a critical threshold and we could see a large number of jobs displaced, leading to critical levels of unemployment in the future. This is especially concerning long term, because the expected HLMI will likely automate many jobs that do not require physical labor entirely and will significantly boost productivity in nearly all occupations.

Current trends suggest that unemployment levels will rise significantly in the coming years. "The International Monetary Fund’s analysis of the global economy predicted that AI would transform the global economy. Around 40% of jobs around the world are exposed to the risks of automation" (Wong, 2024, "Reviewing the Status of Job Automation," para. 10). This aligns with the World Economic Forum's report, which assesses 42% of all business tasks are likely to be fully automated by 2027 (Lowitzsch & Magalhães, 2024, p. 4). Both the IMF and WEF's analyses predict extreme levels of automation and have large implications for the labor market. Supporting that, "According to estimates from a study by Oxford economists Frey and Osborne in the US labor market, 47% of employment could potentially be automated in the next two decades." (Lowitzsch & Magalhães, 2024, p. 4). Automation is expected to affect professions unevenly. "GenAI is likely to create new roles in some sectors yet reduce opportunities in others" (Salari et al., 2025, "Conclusion", para. 1). This agrees with current usage trends that concentrate in software development and writing tasks, which together account for nearly half of all total usage (Handa et al., 2025). These findings, along with forecasts for human level machine intelligence in the next decades, suggest that there will possibly be a prolonged transitional period before a large fraction or most of labor is automated, and the effects will be felt non-uniformly. We have not yet developed strategies that would accommodate people without jobs during this period, but we need to develop them to transition gracefully. Unless addressed, eventual high unemployment rates will also lead to a global economic collapse, which would lead to problems like widespread poverty, political instability, and large-scale social unrest. Although mass unemployment presents serious challenges, the productivity gains from automation remain beneficial. The core concern here is making sure that we adapt to the economy and that the benefits are reaped by everyone.

Apart from unemployment, there are real concerns regarding inequality. For workers, "progress in the field of robotics and AI may lead to the loss of jobs or a radical change in the way tasks are completed, ultimately increasing income and widening the income gap. In low- and middle-income countries, the risk of job loss due to AI is even higher than in advanced economies, with risks being 69 % in India, 72 % in Thailand, 77 % in China, and 85 % in Ethiopia" (Salari et al., 2025, "Discussion", para. 3). Globally, there are concerns of the share of all income shifting from labor towards capital — sources of income that do not require labor, such as real estate and automation — as it has been going on for the past 40 years (Lowitzsch & Magalhães, 2024). More income lets capital owners buy more capital in a self-reinforcing feedback loop. Our current economic systems already lead to a disproportionate concentration of wealth among capital owners and extreme inequality. Advanced AIs would be one of the strongest forms of capital and companies with the most processing power could use it to have an economic advantage over everyone else, thus leading to even more inequality.

Extreme inequality and unemployment pose significant risks of societal unease and turbulence. New economic systems and policies could address these issues. However, research on post-labor economics is limited, which means that we are risking being unprepared for the potential transformation of society. There are policies like Universal Basic Income (UBI), which provides basic income to everyone, and Universal Basic Services (UBS), which provides free universal provision of basic services (Büchs, 2021). UBS is flawed because it would decide what people's needs are for them, decreasing individual autonomy and increasing state control. UBI is better because it addresses issues that arise from unemployment and preserves autonomy, but still makes people tightly dependent on the state. Neither approach has been extensively tested in controlled environments and neither of them addresses concerns regarding extreme inequality because they do not affect structures driving wealth concentration. There are few other alternative policies, such as dividend based economies, but they are also largely theoretical and underexplored. This highlights that we need more funding for testing new economic policies in specially designated areas.

Skeptics may argue that we do not need to invest into these policies because new jobs will be created, as was the case with previous technological advancements. 120 years ago roughly three quarters of all people were farmers, whereas now the number dropped to only one in twenty people (Ekelund, 2024, para. 7). At the time, nobody could predict that so much would change in a single century. "Even 20 years ago, economists probably wouldn’t have predicted that there would be 800,000 personal trainers employed in the US today and 2.5 million jobs in the app development industry" (Ekelund, 2024, para. 7). These examples show how unpredictable the effects of technological advancements are on the nature of labor. According to Ekelund (2024), new jobs could be created due to increases in demand for products and services, whether from improving the quality of said products and services, having new kinds of demands entirely due to the technological evolution of society, or unlocked productivity gains.

Although the idea that new types of labor will appear is consistent with history, it overlooks that advanced AI is a general-purpose technology, capable of taking over not only existing jobs but also any new ones we might create. That is why it is usually known under the umbrella term "Artificial General Intelligence." This does not imply that all jobs will be automated. Certain occupations, such as creative jobs and psychotherapy, may continue to require or prefer human involvement due to their personalized and subjective nature. Guiding AI productivity by deciding the types of products and services developed also requires creativity and familiarity with human preferences. Thus, innovators are less prone to automation but their roles would shift away from traditional employment toward managing and directing AI-driven processes. It is unlikely that all displaced workers could transition into these roles, as they represent only a small fraction of the current labor market. Additionally, new jobs do not address the issue of inequality between those who own capital and those who do not. Preparation for a broader economic transformation is still necessary.

As AI accelerates, preserving social prosperity will require economic adaptation to automation and labor displacement. Although the future remains uncertain, strong early evidence already points toward major disruptions. In this situation, waiting to react would invite crisis; now would be the best time for society to act in a protopian fashion by addressing present risks through continuous improvement. To avoid a future where technological progress deepens inequality and mass unemployment, we need to create resilient economic foundations.
